# Phantom Summoner templates

The 32 templates added for issue #113 come from
[L2J Lisvus C4 npc.sql](https://gitlab.com/TheDnR/l2j-lisvus/-/blob/fdc7e33af5d69067b41a6ee7cc7c07fe7aa35975/datapack/sql/npc.sql):

- Shadow: `12447`–`12455`, skill levels 10–18, NPC levels 60–76.
- Silhouette: `12456`–`12464`, skill levels 10–18, NPC levels 60–76.
- Soulless: `12503`–`12515` and `12538`, skill levels 1–14, NPC levels 42–76.

Regenerate with `node scripts/generate-c4-phantom-summons.js` using the pinned
checkout at `tmp/vendor/l2j-lisvus`, or pass its path as the first argument.
The script preserves unrelated entries in `summons.json`.

Levels, attributes, combat stats, vitals, regeneration, movement, collision,
equipment, faction and rewards are copied from the source. `L2Pet` becomes
the runtime's `Summon` kind. Attack variance, accuracy, corpse time and equipment
reuse time use the existing summon defaults because the SQL has no such fields.
Existing lower-level templates and the fallback for other summon families are
unchanged. Summon levels are determined by the learned skill, not the owner level.

`tests/test_summon_runtime.js` verifies exact template coverage and creation for
all 50 skill levels, including source stat anchors at the added ranges' endpoints.

The same generator imports `npcskills.sql` bindings for all 50 templates and the
five relevant skill definitions from `4100-4199.xml` and `4200-4299.xml` into
`Skills/c4_phantom_summons.json`. These replace legacy bindings for these NPCs:
Shadow's Vampiric Attack, Silhouette's Steal Blood, Soulless's Corpse Burst and
Toxic Smoke, plus Summoned Monster Magic Protection. Race and Contract Payment
are marked `NOTDONE` in the reference and have no executable effect to import.

Runtime checks exercise the native summon commands and actual melee/skill hits:
15% melee absorption, 20% Steal Blood absorption, sourced MP costs and reuse,
rank-scaled poison ticks, and corpse-centered area damage with corpse consumption.
